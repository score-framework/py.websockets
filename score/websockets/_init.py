        The hostname to listen for connnections on.

    :confkey:`port` :confdefault:`8081`
        The port to listen for connnections on.

    :confkey:`stop_timeout` :confdefault:`None`
        Defines how long the module will wait for connections to close
        when pausing the worker. The value will be interpreted through
        a call to :func:`score.init.parse_time_interval`.

        The default value `None` indicates that the module will wait
        indefinitely. If you want to the server to terminate immediately,
        without waiting for open connections at all, you must pass "0".

    :confkey:`reuse_port` :confdefault:`False`
        Whether the ``reuse_port`` keyword argument should be passed to the
        underlying event loop's :meth:`create_server()
        <asyncio.AbstractEventLoop.create_server>` method.
